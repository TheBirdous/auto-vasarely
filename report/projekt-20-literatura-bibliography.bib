    abstract = {Automata and Languages presents a step-by-step development of the theory of automata, languages and computation. Intended to be used as the basis of an introductory course to this theory at both junior and senior levels, the text is organized in such a way as to allow the design of various courses based on selected material. Areas featured in the book include:- * basic models of computation * formal languages and their properties * computability, decidability and complexity * a discussion of the modern trends in the theory of automata and formal languages * design of programming languages, including the development of a new programming language * compiler design, including the construction of a complete compiler Alexander Meduna uses clear definitions, easy-to-follow proofs and helpful examples to make formerly obscure concepts easy to understand. He also includes challenging exercises and programming projects to enhance the reader's comprehension, and, to put the theory firmly into a 'real world' context, he presents lots of realistic illustrations and applications in practical computer science.},

@book{RozenbergGrzegorz1997HoFL,
    abstract = {The need for a comprehensive survey-type exposition on formal languages and related mainstream areas of computer science has been evident for some years. In the early 1970s, when . the book Formal Languages by the second­ mentioned editor appeared, it was still quite feasible to write a comprehensive book with that title and include also topics of current research interest. This would not be possible anymore. A standard-sized book on formal languages would either have to stay on a fairly low level or else be specialized and restricted to some narrow sector of the field. The setup becomes drastically different in a collection of contributions, where the best authorities in the world join forces, each of them concentrat­ ing on their own areas of specialization. The present three-volume Handbook constitutes such a unique collection. In these three volumes we present the current state of the art in formal language theory. We were most satisfied with the enthusiastic response given to our request for contributions by specialists representing various subfields. The need for a Handbook of Formal Languages was in many answers expressed in different ways: as an easily accessible his­ torical reference, a general source of information, an overall course-aid, and a compact collection of material for self-study. We are convinced that the final result will satisfy such various needs. The theory of formal languages constitutes the stem or backbone of the field of science now generally known as theoretical computer science.},

@book{MedunaFormalLang,
    abstract = {This textbook gives a systematized and compact summary, providing the most essential types of modern models for languages and computation together with their properties and applications. Most of these models properly reflect and formalize current computational methods, based on parallelism, distribution and cooperation covered in this book. As a result, it allows the user to develop, study, and improve these methods very effectively.This textbook also represents the first systematic treatment of modern language models for computation. It covers all essential theoretical topics concerning them. From a practical viewpoint, it describes various concepts, methods, algorithms, techniques, and software units based upon these models. Based upon them, it describes several applications in biology, linguistics, and computer science. Advanced-level students studying computer science, mathematics, linguistics and biology will find this textbook a valuable resource. Theoreticians, practitioners and researchers working in today's theory of computation and its applications will also find this book essential as a reference.},
